    minesweeper and beat expert mode.  Upload your names with a screen shot of your time and let's see who is the fastest.</p>

    hit a mine hear bad luck just restart.  The numbers tell you how many mines that number is touching.  There is a maximum
    of 8 different locations it can be touching.  They are: left, right, up, down, up and right, up and left, down and right, down and left.
