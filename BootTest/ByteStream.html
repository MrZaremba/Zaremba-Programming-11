    <h1 class="text-lg-center">Data Stream</h1>
    <p>We have been using data streams this entire course.  Now we are going to take a much closer look at how they work.  Java I/O stands
    for Java IN OUT.  The "in" and the "out" are streams of data.  Streams of data are linked to physical components of your computer.  It is
    how we get information such as keyboard input.  When we press a key it sends the stream of data to the system.  The way the
    keyboard sends information is by sending a single byte of data for a key press.  A byte of data is equal to 8 bits and 1 bit is
    a simple 0 or 1 in binary.  The purpose of this lesson is not to dive into binary but to understand how we can get data streams and
    make sense of them in our programs.  When we hit a key it sends 1 byte of data which is a number.  This number gets translated into a key
    by the ASCII (defines what numbers are equal to what keys).  Example the lower case 'a' is equal to the number 97.</p>
    <h2>Byte Stream</h2>
    <p>Recall when using a <b>Scanner</b> object the parameter for the constructor was <b>System.in</b>.  This is our basic form of
    input stream to get information.  It is in the form byte stream which we will see in an example has cumbersome process to convert it
     to a string like we were doing in some of our programs.  Likewise, <b>System.out</b> is the output stream that we use to print to
    the console.  Streams have more uses however, then simply getting characters from a keyboard and printing characters to the console.
    It can read from files stored on the hard drive, write to files stored on the hard drive, copy files, send information over networks,
    receive information over networks, and many other ways your computer can send and receive data.  The first one we will look at
    is the byte stream.  The byte stream is the simplest form of data streams; once we are done this unit you most likely will not
    use the byte stream as we have other classes that are easier to use however, they are all based off of the byte stream and are what
    we sometimes refer to as "wrappers" to make the class easier to use.  The following video shows a simple example of using a byte
    stream.</p>

    <h2>Check Your Understanding</h2>
    <p>Which of the following is NOT a data stream?</p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3 answer" onclick="getAnswer(false)">getting data from a file</div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 answer" onclick="getAnswer(false)">keyboard inputs
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 answer" onclick="getAnswer(true)">returning an object from a method.
            integer.
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 answer" onclick="getAnswer(false)">getting data from a server</div>
    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-success invisible" id="solution">
        <strong id="grade"></strong> All data streams interact with a form of hardware.  Reading a file interacts with hard drive,
        keyboard inputs interacts with keyboard, getting data from a server interacts with network card.  Returning an object form a
        method is software to software within your program it is not considered a data stream.
