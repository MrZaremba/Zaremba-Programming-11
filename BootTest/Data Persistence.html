    <p>This topic can be extremely vast, so we are only going to look at a small portion of it.  So far with our programs you may
    have noticed that every time we run the code every variable, list, or object gets reset.  I am sure you have used programs that
    remembers you and where you left off.  Now that we can write information to the disk we can also use our program to retreive it later.
    This means we could feasibly write down all the information that currently is in our program, retrieve it later and start where we
    left off. </p>
