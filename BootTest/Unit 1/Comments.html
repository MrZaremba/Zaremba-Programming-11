    <h1 class="text-lg-center">Comments</h1>
    <p>Comments are used to write notes to ourselves or future programmers.  They are not considered code.  We can
    write anything we want in comments.  They often contain information about what our code does.  We have to main types of comments
     they are:<br><code>//single line comment<br>/*<br>multiple<br>line<br>comments<br>*/</code></p>
    <p>There is a third type of comment that can be used to create java docs.  Later in the course we will cover
    these comments but they are much more extensive in what they can do.  For now we will be only using these comments.
    As you learn more and more about objects and methods we will utilise comments to ensure that our code is more readable.</p>
    <h2>Check Your Understanding</h2>
    <p>From the examples below which are acceptable forms of comments:</p>
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-around mb-lg-3">
        <div onclick="getAnswer(false)" class="p-2 answer">Answer:<br> #This variable should contain an integer;</div>
        <div onclick="getAnswer(false)" class="p-2 answer">Answer:<br>//This variable should contain an integer;</div>
        <div onclick="getAnswer(true)" class="p-2 answer">Answer:<br>//This variable should contain an integer</div>
    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-success invisible" id="solution">
        <strong id="grade"></strong> Solution:  //This variable should contain an integer<br> Because we do not need semicolons
        at the end of comments they are not statements of code.
