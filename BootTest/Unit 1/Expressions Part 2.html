    <p>A function and programming simply put is a series of expressions that we give a name.  We can then refer to this name
        to instantly run all the expressions in this group.</p>
    <p>Functions in programming can operate very similar to mathematical functions.  We can take in some sort of input,
        the independent variable, perform some operations on it, then we get back the dependent variable as a result.  You can think of
        functions in programming like a black box that takes in information and gives back information.  What happens inside or how
        this box does this does not really matter as long as we know that it works.</p>

    <p>In programming however, some functions take in no parameters and send out no information.  They simply run some sort of
        task behind the scenes</p>
    <h2>How functions evaluate</h2>
    <p>When information is taken into a function and then information is sent out this will also evaluate.  We can treat these
        functions just like primitives.  We can run operations on them and receive values.  Some examples of built in functions in java
        are the math functions.  Remember our primitive operators do not include items such as exponents, square roots, trigonometry ratios, etc.
        We need at times to use this math in programming.  We could write these functions our selves and use them but often
        somebody else has already done this.  We can just use their functions within our programs</p>
    <p>Watch the following video to see how we can perform expressions on functions and how they will evaluate</p>

    <h2>Check Your Understanding</h2>
    <p>What will the following expression evaluate to?<br> (9 % 4) - 8 + Math.pow(2,3) + (Math.sqrt(9) / 3)</p>
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-around mb-lg-3">
        <div onclick="getAnswer(true)" class="p-2 answer">Answer: 2</div>
        <div onclick="getAnswer(false)" class="p-2 answer">Answer: 0</div>
    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-success invisible" id="solution">
        <strong id="grade"></strong><br> The solution is 2 because:<br> (9 % 4) - 8 + Math.pow(2,3) + (Math.sqrt(9) / 3)
        <br> (1) - 8 + 8 + (3/3)
        <br> 1 + 1
        <br> 2
