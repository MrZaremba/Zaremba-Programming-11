    <h1 class="text-lg-center">Expressions Part 1</h1>
    <p>Expressions are used in programming to evaluate primary data.  Expressions in programming are much like expressions in math.
        We will have at least 2 features to an expression, they must have <b>Operators and Operands</b></p>
    <p>Operands are what we call primitive forms of data.  We will be working with 4 main types</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>integers, numbers without decimals</p></li>
        <li><p>floats, which are numbers with decimals</p></li>
        <li><p>booleans, true or false</p></li>
        <li><p>characters, single letters</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>There are many operators but first we will look into mathematical operators.  We will
        primarily be using these 7 throughout the course.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>addition '+'</p></li>
        <li><p>subtraction '-'</p></li>
        <li><p>multiplication '*'</p></li>
        <li><p>division '/'</p></li>
        <li><p>modulus '%'</p></li>
        <li><p>increment '++'</p></li>
        <li><p>decrement '--'</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>To build a basic expression we have &lt;operand&gt;&lt;operator&gt;&lt;operand&gt;.  An example would be 5 + 6</p>
    <h2>Evaluation</h2>
    <p>Evaluating an expression is how the computer reads the expression and assigns a value to it.  In the example above 5 + 6 = 11</p>
    <p>This may seem obvious but later on how expressions evaluate can become confusing.  It is also important to understand that
        the compiler does not care about the 5 + 6 part is simply reads it as 11.  Programming language like math also rely on Order
        of operations. </p>
    <h2>Something is wrong</h2>
    <p>Inside of your System.out.println() try running the expression '28 / 6' and see what you get. Notice that outcome is simply 4.
        This is because 28 and 6 are both integers.  The compiler reads the data as integers which means no decimal places.  So when it evaluates
        this expression is only reads the integer value.  It ignores any fraction that is left over.  It is not rounding the number it is simply <b>Cutting off the value of the fraction</b></p>
    <h2>Check Your Understanding</h2>
    <p>What will the following expression evaluate to?<br> (2 - 3) * 4 + (14 - 7) / 4</p>
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-around mb-lg-3">
        <div onclick="getAnswer(true)" class="p-2 answer">Answer: -3</div>
        <div onclick="getAnswer(false)" class="p-2 answer">Answer: -2.25</div>
    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-success invisible" id="solution">
        <strong id="grade"></strong> The solution is -3 because of Integer math.  When we divide by integers we cut off any decimal and are
        left only with whole numbers.  so (14 - 7) / 4 evaluates to 7/4 = 1.
