    <h1 class="text-lg-center">Formatting Println</h1>
    <p>To start learning programming it is much easier to learn while use what we call the console to display information.
    Learning to code a graphical user interface or a GUI is difficult and time consuming.  It also requires knowledge of code that
        you have yet to learn.  This is why when starting out we will be using the console.  Sometimes it is we need to format what
    we print to the console so that it is more readable.  We have a few ways we can accomplish this.</p>
    <h2>Print vs Println</h2>
    <p>We have to ways we can print to the console the print and println statements.  Here is the code for both:<br><code>
        System.out.println(String);<br>System.out.print(String);<br>
    </code>The difference is println will start a new line each statement.  While the print will not it will lay the items side
    by side.</p>
    <h2>Escape Characters</h2>
    <p>Sometimes we need to enter in characters that are either not on our keyboard or the compiler would read as code.  To
    enter these characters we can use something called escape characters.  Here is a table of the commonly used ones:</p>
    <table class="table table-responsive-md table-striped mw-100">
        <tr>
            <th>Escape Sequence</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>\t</td>
            <td>Insert a tab in the text at this point</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>\b</td>
            <td>Insert a backspace at this point.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>\n</td>
            <td>Insert a new line in the text at this point.</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>\r</td>
            <td>Insert a carriage return in the text at this point</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>\'</td>
            <td>Insert a single quote in the text at this point</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>\"</td>
            <td>Insert a double quote in the text at this point</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>\\</td>
            <td>Insert a backslash in the text at this point</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>Example:<br><code>
        System.out.println("Index\tValue\n0\t\t1\n1\t\t2";
    </code></p>

    <h2>Getting User Input</h2>
    <p>Getting user input is a very large topic in programming.  Later in the course we will get into this topic in great detail.  However,
    we will need to in some of our programs leading up to that topic get user input to make them more interactive.  We will be using something similiar
    to the Math functions from the previous lessons about expressions.  We will use what is called the scanner.  To use the scanner we must first import it.
    Jave automatically imports the Math for you so it is not necessary but the scanner we must import it our selves.  Here is how we set it up:<br>
    <code>import java.util.Scanner;<br>
    public class ScanStuff{<br>&emsp;public static void main(String args[]){<br>&emsp;&emsp;Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);<br>&emsp;
    &emsp;}<br>}<br></code>This sets up the scanner.  What all that code means we will get to eventually.  For now just accept that is what we do.
    Now we can scan for user input.  To use the scanner add the following lines of code.<br><code>
            System.out.println("What is your name?");<br>String name = scan.next();<br>System.out.println(name);<br>
        </code>scan.next() will evaluate to a String of what ever the user inputs into the console.  When the code is run it will wait
    for user input in the console.  Try typing something and make sure it prints correctly.</p>
