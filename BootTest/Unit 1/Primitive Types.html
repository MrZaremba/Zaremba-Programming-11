    <h1 class="text-lg-center">Primitive Data Types</h1>
    <p>Primitive data types will be the first type of data in we will learn to store inside of our programs.  To store
    information we need to create what we call variables.  Variables in java either point to primitive data stored on the
    on the computer or they will point to a reference to an object (more on this later).</p>
    <p>Variables in programming are very similar to variables in math.  They are place holders for information
    we do not yet have.  These variables can change as the program is running.  To create a variable in java we must declare
    a <b>Type</b>.  The table below is a list of the most commonly used primitive types:</p>
    <table class="table table-responsive-md table-striped mw-100">
        <tr>
            <th>Type</th>
            <th>Abbreviation</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Integer</td>
            <td>int</td>
            <td>Positive and negative whole numbers to a maximum or minimum value</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Double</td>
            <td>double</td>
            <td>Numbers that contain decimals.  2 pieces of information is stored. Value to either side of decimal</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Boolean</td>
            <td>boolean</td>
            <td>True or False value</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Character</td>
            <td>char</td>
            <td>A single letter</td>
        </tr>
    </table>

    <h2>Declaring a Variable</h2>
    <p>To declare a variable we first declare the type then the name followed by a semicolon &lt;type&gt; &lt;name&gt;;<br>
    Example: <code>int x;</code><br> This creates a spot in memory and names that location 'x'.  After we have declared the variable
    we can use an <b>assignment operator '='</b> to specify what integer value you wish it to hold <br>
    <code>x = 10;</code><br></p>
    <p>We can now use the variable we create in code to evaluate expressions.  Look at the following example. <br>
    <code>int x = 10;<br>int y = x * 2;</code><br>In this example we first declare and assign in one line the variable
    'x' and assign it 10.  Then we created and assigned the variable 'y' and used the value from 'x' as a number in the expression.</p>
    <h2>Data Abstraction</h2>
    <p>The concept of data abstraction will be looked at over the entire course.  Data abstraction is the idea of assigning
    meaning to the information that is stored in the program.  For primitive types of data it is fairly simplistic.  Once we start
    learning how to code more complex data the abstraction can become difficult.  Here is a simple way we can assign meaning to a
    primitive data type.<br><code>boolean lightsOn = true;</code><br>This even to someone who knows little to nothing about code
    can abstract what information this variable is holding.  By assigning appropriate names to values we can give the values meaning.</p>
    <p>Here is a video of more ways we can use simple variables in code:</p>

    <h2>Check Your Understanding</h2>
    <p>Is the following statement going to create an error:<br><code>int x = 10;<br>double y = x;<br>int z = y;</code></p>
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-around mb-lg-2">
        <div onclick="getAnswer(false)" class="p-2 answer">Answer: This code will have an error because 'y' is a double and cannot be assigned to 'z'</div>
        <div onclick="getAnswer(true)" class="p-2 answer">Answer: This code will not have an error because 'y' is assigned an integer value so 'z' will take on
            the assigned integer value.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-success invisible" id="solution">
        <strong id="grade"></strong> This code will create an error.  When double 'y' is assigned to 'x' it will add storage space for holding
        decimals.  When we try use 'y' to create 'z', 'y' is a double and cannot be assigned to an integer.  Note with a topic called casting
        it is possible.
