    <h1 class="text-lg-center">Relational Operators</h1>
    <p>Recall the operators from our previous lesson in expressions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><p>addition '+'</p></li>
        <li><p>subtraction '-'</p></li>
        <li><p>multiplication '*'</p></li>
        <li><p>division '/'</p></li>
        <li><p>modulus '%'</p></li>
        <li><p>increment '++'</p></li>
        <li><p>decrement '--'</p></li>
    </ul>
    <p>We have additional operation we can perform called <bold>relational operators</bold>.  These are used to compare 2 values.
      When relational operators evaluate they will always result in a boolean (true or false).  The table below shows what relational
    operators we will be using (Not all of them are listed just the commonly used operators):</p>
    <table class="table table-responsive-md table-striped mw-100">
        <tr>
            <th>Operator</th>
            <th>Description</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;</td>
            <td>Tests if a value is less than another value</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&gt;</td>
            <td>Tests if a value is greater than another value</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&lt;=</td>
            <td>Tests if a value is less than or equal to another</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>&gt;=</td>
            <td>Tests if a value is greater than or equal to another</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>==</td>
            <td>Tests if a value equal to another</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>!=</td>
            <td>Tests if a value is not equal to another</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>These operations are for testing primitive data only.  We can not use them on testing other forms of data.
    Currently the only none primitive form of data we can make are Strings.  We will learn others and the same rule will
    apply.  It is also important to note comaparing equality is not done with an '=' sign but with '=='.  This is because
    '=' is call an assignment operator.  It assigns values to variables.  We need to use something else to compare equality
    which is why we use '=='.</p>
    <h2>Evaluating Relational Operators</h2>
    <p>Remember that when we evaluate comaparative operators we will get a boolean as a result.  For example, 10 > 9 is true while
     10 < 9 is false.  Examples in code:<br><code>System.out.println(10 != 10);<br></code>evaluates to false.  This is because 10
     is equal to 10 which means the statement 10 ! 10 is false.</p>
    <h2>Check Your Understanding</h2>
    <p><code>System.out.println(12 >= 12.0)</code></p>
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-around mb-lg-3">
        <div onclick="getAnswer(true)" class="p-2 answer">Answer: true</div>
        <div onclick="getAnswer(false)" class="p-2 answer">Answer: false</div>
    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-success invisible" id="solution">
        <strong id="grade"></strong> Solution: true.  In some languages we also compare data types.  So 12 would not be equal to 12.0 because
        12.0 is a double while 12 is an integer.  In java we can compare integers and doubles.
