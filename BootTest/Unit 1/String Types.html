    <h1 class="text-lg-center">Strings</h1>
    <p>So far we have only dealt with data that has a single piece of data.  Strings are different in that they are
    not considered to be primitive data types.  They consist of multiple primitive data, which are of type character.
    Strings are a "string" of characters to form words, numbers, symbols or a anything we need them to be.  They are
    our first type of data that is <b>Iterable</b>.  What that means is that the String has index positions.  Index
    positions point to a value at specific spot. Here is an example of index positions of a string:</p>
    <table class="table table-striped table-responsive-sm smaller">
        <tr>
            <th>Index</th>
            <th>Value</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>0</td>
            <td>H</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>1</td>
            <td>e</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>2</td>
            <td>l</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>3</td>
            <td>l</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>4</td>
            <td>o</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <h2>Indexing</h2>
    <p>Indexing in programming always starts off at 0.  This means in the string "Hello" there are 5 positions labeled 0
    through 4.  We can use code to read what hte value at each index position is.  With strings however, they are what we call
    <bold>Immutable</bold>.  This means we cannot go in and change the value of any index position.  WIth other <b>Iterable</b>
    data we can but not strings.  The following code shows how we can grab values of index positions:<br>
    <code>String name = "Patrick Stewart";<br>String lastName = name.substring(8,15);<br>System.out.println(lastName);<br></code>
        The output of the following code is Stewart.  The example above is called string <b>slicing</b>.  We can also
    <b>concatenate</b> strings.  This means combine 2 strings together.  Example:<br><code>String firstName = "John";<br>
        String lastName = "Stewart";<br> String fullName = lastName + firstName;<br></code> This will combine the strings
    together to get the a full name.</p>

    <p>What will be printed to the console from the following code:<br><code>String school = "Windemere";<br>
        String city = "Vancouver";<br>System.out.println(school.substring(0,3) + "y " + city.substring(3,8));</code></p>

        a character.
