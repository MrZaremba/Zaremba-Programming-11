    <h1 class="text-lg-center">Else and Else if Statements</h1>
    <h2>Else statements</h2>
    <p>When we were creating if statements the block of code inside the statement would run only if the condition is true.
    After words regardless if the statement was true or false we could continue to run our programs.  What if we want to
    run a block of code if the statement is true and a different block if the statement is false. This is where the else
    statement comes into play.  Here is the general form of an else if statement:<br><code>if(<i>condition</i>){<br>
        &emsp;<i>block of code if true<br></i>&emsp;}<br>else{<br>&emsp14;<i>block of code if false</i><br>&emsp;}</code></p>
    <p>Notice that the else statement does not have a condition.  There is no need for one as it is only going to run when its
    preceding if statement's condition is false.  </p>
    <h2>Else if Statement</h2>
    <p>The else if statement is similiar to the else statement.  The main difference is that it requires its own condition
    to execute its block of code.  Here is the general format for the else if statement:<br><code>
            if(<i>condition</i>){<br>&emsp;<i>block of code if statement is true</i><br>&emsp;}<br>
            else if(<i>condition</i>){<br>&emsp;<i>block of code if statement is true</i><br>&emsp;}<br>
            else{<br>&emsp;<i>block of code if all above statements are false</i><br>&emsp;}
        </code></p>
    <p>There can be multiple else if statements after the initial if statement.  Each one can only be acccessed if all the
    conditions prior to it evaluate to false.  If any of the conditions through out the statement chain ever evaluate to true.  The
    corresponding  block of code will run and every successive statement will be skipped over.</p>

    <h2>Check Your Understanding</h2>
    <p>Looking at the following code what will be printed to the console:<br><code>
        boolean isFlying = true;<br>
        boolean isFalling = false;<br>
        if(!isFlying){<br>
        &emsp;System.out.println("You are not flying then the must mean your falling.");<br>
        &emsp;}<br>
        else if(!isFlying && !isFalling){<br>
        &emsp;System.out.println("You would think that if you are not flying you are falling");<br>
        &emsp;}<br>
        else{<br>&emsp;System.out.println("You must have crashed");<br>&emsp;}<br>
        System.out.println("Do you want to try flying again?");
    </code></p>
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-around mb-lg-3">
        <div onclick="getAnswer(false)" class="p-2 answer">You must have crashed</div>
        <div onclick="getAnswer(true)" class="p-2 answer">You must have crashed<br>Do you want to try flying again?</div>
        <div onclick="getAnswer(false)" class="p-2 answer">You would think that if you are not flying you are falling<br>Do you want to try flying again?</div>
    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-success invisible" id="solution">
        <strong id="grade"></strong> Solution: <br> You must have crashed <br> Do you want to try flying again?<br>
        The condition !isFlying returns false sending you to else if statement.  That condition also returns false sending you to
        the else statement.  THe last line prints no matter what as it is not in the conditional statement.
