    <h1 class="text-lg-center">While Loop</h1>
    <p>The problem with branching programs is that the code only flows in one direction.  Take your paper rock scissors game for example.
    Once the user submitted their input the code ran the program ended.  It would be better if the code would go back to the beginning
    and start over.  It could keep doing this until the user puts in a certain input.  That is one use for loops or iterations.  Here
    is an example of the format of a while loop:<br><code>while(<i>condition</i>){<br>&emsp;<i>block of code</i><br>&emsp;}</code></p>
    <p>The condition just like in if and else if statements always evaluates to a boolean.  The loop will continue to run as long as the
    condition is true.  Once it turns false the loop will stop and the code will jump past the block.</p>
    <h2>Do While Loop</h2>
    <p>This is very similiar to the while loop.  The only difference is that it checks the condition after the loop is complete.
    This should be used in a case where you want to guarantee the loop runs at least once.  The general format for the do while loop is:
    <br><code>do{<br>&emsp;<i>block of code</i><br>&emsp;}while(<i>condition</i>);<br></code>This will run the block of code
    then check the condition.</p>
    <h2>Infinite Loops</h2>
    <p>Infinite loops occur when the programmer does not lay in a condition that will every become false.  This can occur by accident
    and will cause the program will crash or freeze your computer.  Be sure to double check your conditions when using iterations.</p>
    <h2>Check Your Understanding</h2>
    <p>What will be the output of the following code:<br><code>int x = 5;<br>while(x > 0){<br>&emsp;System.out.print(x + ", ");<br>
    &emsp;x--;<br>&emsp;}</code></p>
    <div class="d-flex justify-content-around mb-lg-3">
        <div onclick="getAnswer(true)" class="p-2 answer">5, 4, 3, 2, 1</div>
        <div onclick="getAnswer(false)" class="p-2 answer">4, 3, 2, 1, 0</div>
        <div onclick="getAnswer(false)" class="p-2 answer">5, 4, 3, 2, 1, 0</div>
    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-success invisible" id="solution">
        <strong id="grade"></strong> The solution is 5, 4, 3, 2, 1<br>It starts out at 5 because the decrement to x is after the print
        statement.  It does not print 0 because once 'x' is 0 the condition is false and the loop will not run.
