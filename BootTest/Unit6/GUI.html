    <h1 class="text-lg-center">GUI's</h1>
    <p>So far we have been using console commands to write our programs.  A long time ago it was common to use programs
    that ran from a console but now we use Graphical User Interfaces.  These are much easier for users to control programs.
    It requires very little computer knowledge from the user to be able to use the software.  Writing GUI's from scratch
    requires knowledge of code that goes beyond the scope of this course.  We will use a graphical user interface to create
    our graphical user interfaces.  This will simplify the code for us.</p>

    <h2>Java FX</h2>
    <p>There are 3 types of libraries we can choose from to create GUI's in Java.  They are AWT, Swing, and Java FX.  We will
    be using Java FX as it is the newest addition and it has the most functionality.  It allows users to create more modern
    looking programs.  If we used swing or AWT classes to create our GUI the application we are creating would look like it
    is out of the 90's.  Java FX gives features that can make your program look more modern.  The main feature that was added to
    JAva FX to modernize it was the use of CSS files.  We can use a CSS file to change the look of our application.  CSS files have
    been primarily used in web design but can now be used with java.  We will not be getting into how to use CSS files as
    they do no improve the functionality of our program but merely its look.</p>

    <h2>Scene Builder</h2>
    <p>We will be using the scene builder to create our GUi's.  It can be found <a href="https://gluonhq.com/products/scene-builder/" target="_blank">
        here.</a>  We will also be using JDK 8 which can be downloaded from
        <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html" target="_blank">here.  </a>
        For the next few lessons it will be easier to use videos to explain how to use the scene builder.  We will not
    be learning much new code but rather how to use the scene builder and create projects with it.</p>
