    <h2>Review</h2>
    <p>Primitive data types are our basic forms of data such as numbers, booleans and characters.  When we create a variable
    that is storing primitive data we are creating a spot in memory and inside of that location storing the value assigned.
    Reference data types we have used when creating objects.  They operate differently.  We have seen that when we print an
    object that we can see its location in memory printed.  We have often override the method responsible for this to match our
    purposes  but understanding assigning a variable to location in memory is different from assigning a variable to store data.
      We can see examples on the different behaviours in the following video:</p>
