    <h1 class="text-lg-center">More on Control Flow</h1>
    <p>There are a few more items we can now add on to our control flow.  We will learn how to use a "switch" statement and we
    will learn how to use a nested loop</p>

    <h2>Switch Statement</h2>
    <p>These statements operate similiar to "if" and "else if" statements.  In fact switch statements could be done using
    if and else if statements.  However, sometimes it is just easier to use a switch.  Especially when dealing with a type of
    data called "enumerations" (These will not be covered).  A switch statement takes in a variable and checks various cases on it.
    When it finds the appropriate case it will execute the block of code.  Example: <br><code>
            String dayOfWeek = "Friday";
            switch(dayOfWeek){
            &emsp;case "Monday":<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;System.out.println("It is Monday");<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;break;<br>
            &emsp;case "Tuesday":<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;System.out.println("It is Tuesday");<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;break;<br>
            &emsp;case "Wednesday":<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;System.out.println("It is Wednesday");<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;break;<br>
            &emsp;case "Thursday":<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;System.out.println("It is Thursday");<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;break;<br>
            &emsp;case "Friday":<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;System.out.println("It is Friday");<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;break;<br>
            &emsp;case "Saturday":<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;System.out.println("It is Saturday");<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;break;<br>
            &emsp;case "Sunday":<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;System.out.println("It is Sunday");<br>
            &emsp;&emsp;break;<br>
            &emsp;}<br>
        </code>Once it finds the case equal to "Friday" it will execute that block of code.  Notice the break statements on each
    case.  Without these it would keep running.</p>
    <h2>Nested Loops</h2>
    <p>Nested loops are loops within loops.  These can be very useful for different algorithms such as sorting or working with
    something we will get to later called 2d arrays.  When running nested loops learning to follow the blocks of code can
     be tricky.  Here is a simply example:<br><code>
            for(int i=1; i<11;i++){<br>&emsp;for(int j = 1;j<6;j++){<br>&emsp;&emsp;System.out.print(i*j + "\t");<br>&emsp;&emsp;}<br>
            &emsp;System.out.println("");<br>&emsp;}
        </code><br> Would create a multiplication table.  Give it a try in Intelij to see what it looks like.</p>
    <h2>Check Your Understanding</h2>
    <p>What would the output be for the following block of code:<br><code>
        for(int i=1; i<4;i++){<br>&emsp;for(int j = 4;j>1;j--){<br>&emsp;&emsp;System.out.println("i is: " + i
        + "\tj is: " + j");<br>&emsp;&emsp;}<br>
        &emsp;}
    </code><br> Would create a multiplication table.  Give it a try in Intelij to see what it looks like.</p></p>
