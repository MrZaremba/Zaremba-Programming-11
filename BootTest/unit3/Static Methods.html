    <h1 class="text-lg-center">Static Methods</h1>
    <p>Methods or functions are blocks of code that have been given a "name".  They are like functions in math.  They take in
    some input and they give an output.  We have seen a few functions so such as <code>Math.pow(2,3)</code>.  Math is not a
    function which we will not refer to as methods.  The pow(2,3) is the actual method.  The Math portion is called a class
    which we will be getting to soon.  Methods can take in <b>parameters</b> and <b>return</b> values.  Or it could do
    neither.  It depends what we want the method to accomplish.  Here is the general format for a method:<br><code>
            <i>signature</i> <b>name</b>(<i>parameters</i>){<br>&emsp;<i>block of code</i> <br> &emsp; return value if there is one
            <br>&emsp;}
        </code></p>
    <p>Naming methods should always be a good description of what the method accomplishes.  This is another example of data abstraction.
    This method is essentially going to become a piece of data and we need to give it meaning as well.  Naming conventions
     in java for methods are first word in name starts with a lowercase letter and any consecutive words start with an upper
    case letter.  Note your method name should rarely be more than two words in length.</p>
    <h2>Signature</h2>
    <p>Signatures in Java a few parts to them.  They are declaring a few things about method before we get to the name and parameters.
    The first part of the signature is accessibility, what classes are allowed to use this method.  The second part of the signature is
    stating the return value.  This will be a data <b>type</b> or <b>void</b>.  If you have a data type the method must return that
    data type.  If it is void then it returns nothing.</p>
    <h2>Parameters</h2>
    <p>Parameters are used to give the method additional information.  For example the Math.pow(2,3) requires to parameters to run.  It needs
    the base of the power and the exponent of the power.  Without these how could it know what you wanted?</p>
    <h2>Return Values</h2>
    <p>Methods do not have to return anything.  However, if they do return a value, that value will be sent to where the method is "called".
    Calling a method is how we invoke the code to run.  For example, when we typed in <code>Math.pow(2,3)</code> that was us calling the method.
    When it returned its double value it would be inserted where the method was called.  This would evaluate the invocation of the method to the
    return type.  If a method has no return type then it simply would evaluate to null.</p>
    <h2>Example of a static method</h2>
    <p>Here we will show you an example of a static method that can calculate the pythagorean theorem of a right angle triangle<br><code>
        //returns the hypotenuse of a right angle triangle given side 'a' and 'b'
        static double pyth(double a, double b){<br>
        &emsp;return Math.sqrt((a*a + b*b));<br>&emsp;}
    </code><br>Here is how we could call it in our code:<br><code>
        double a = 4;<br>double b = 3;<br>double c = pyth(a, b);<br>

    </code>This will set the double c to the value of the hypotenuse of the right angle triangle.</p>

    <h2>Check Your Understanding</h2>
    <p>What would be a suitable name for this method?  What would you have to fix to make it work?<br><code>
        static double theMeth(int a, int b){<br>&emsp; int returnVal = a;<br>&emsp;if(b == 0) return 1;<br>&emsp;for(int i = 0;i < b;i++){<br>&emsp;&emsp;returnVal *= a;
        <br>&emsp;&emsp;}<br>&emsp;return returnVal;<br>&emsp;}<br>
    </code></p>

        <div class="col-lg-3 answer" onclick="getAnswer(false)">Name: power Fix: Make sure the parameters are doubles.</div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 answer" onclick="getAnswer(true)">Name: power Fix: Make sure the return values is an integer. </div>
