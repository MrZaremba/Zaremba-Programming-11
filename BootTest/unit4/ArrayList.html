    <h1 class="text-lg-center">ArrayList Class</h1>
    <p>One of the most important parts of programming is not just learning how OOP works, designing methods, and understanding
    control flow.  These items re very similiar across all languages.  Learning how to use prebuilt classes or libraries
    is a very important part.  This lesson is designed to teach you how to use a commonly class called the ArrayList.  This
    class is part of a bigger group of classes called "Collections".  For this course we will only be using the ArrayList
    class as it is common and we will have many uses for it.  As the name suggests it operates similiar to an array.  The
    main difference is it has several pre built methods and features.  When we learned about arrays you had to write 3 methods.
    Add/Insert and Delete values from the array.  Some of you may have realized how common these methods are and wondered
    would they not have already been coded by someone? Why not just use their work code?  Do I have to right this code into any
    program every time I want to use these features.  The nice part of OOP is that we can import packages(collection of classes)
    and use their pre built class in our code.</p>
    <h2>Using the ArrayList Class</h2>
    <p>To start we need to import the class at the top of our project.  The code to write this is <code>import java.util.ArrayList;</code>
      This gives us access to the class.  We can import simply by creating a variable with type "ArrayList&lt;object type&gt;" then
    the IDE will underline it in red and ask if we want <kbd>alt + enter</kbd> and that will automatically input it.  Here is
    an example of creating an arrayList to hold cars:<br><code>ArrayList&lt;Cars&gt; carList = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();</code><br>
    The angled brackets dictating what type of object is being held in the array list are called <b>generics</b>.  This is a topic
     beyond the scope of this course.  We just simply need to know how to use it.</p>
    <h2>Using the class built in methods</h2>
    <p>There are several built in methods in the ArrayList class that we can utilize.  Here is a list of the most common:</p>
    <table class="table table-responsive-md table-striped">
        <tr>
            <th>Method</th>
            <th>Functionality</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>add(int i, E element)</td>
            <td>Adds an item to list at position 'i'(or just use E element as parameter and added to end of list)</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>clear()</td>
            <td>Clears the list</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>get(int i)</td>
            <td>Gets the element stored at position 'i'</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>isEmpty()</td>
            <td>Returns true if list is empty, else it returns false</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>remove(int i)</td>
            <td>Removes element at index position 'i'</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>size()</td>
            <td>Returns an integer of size of list</td>
        </tr>
    </table>
    <p>There are others.  All java libraries come with a Java Doc.  You can find the ArrayList java doc
    by clicking <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html" target="_blank">here.</a>  This
    shows a list of all the methods and the parameters along with a description.  There is more information on the class such
     as its constructors.  I will let you explore it.  Any built in class in java we are using will have a javadoc.  To access
    them you can typically google the class name and javadoc to find it.  Later in the course I will show you how to generate
    javadocs for your projects.</p>
    <h2>ArrayLists of Primitives</h2>
    <p>The array list cannot hold primitives it can only hold objects.  Java has created several built in objects that are
     designed to hold primitives.  So if wanted to make an ArratyList of integers we can use the Integer object.<br><code>
            ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt; myNums = new ArrayList&lt;&gt;();<br>
        </code> This will create a list holding Integer Objects.  You have briefly seen this in use when we used the
    <code>Integer.parseInt(String s)</code> to change a string into an integer.</p>
    <p>We have learned a lot the past 3 lessons about how to use classes this video will bring it all together with a simple
    example.</p>

    <h2>Check Your Understanding</h2>
    <p>Using the Javadoc what does the following methods do?<br>toArray();</p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-3 answer" onclick="getAnswer(false)">Nothing it is not an array.</div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 answer" onclick="getAnswer(false)">Creates an array of the same size as the list.
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 answer" onclick="getAnswer(false)">This only works when we are storing primitives in an ArrayList
            integer.
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-3 answer" onclick="getAnswer(true)">Returns an array hold all the elements in proper sequence.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-success invisible" id="solution">
        <strong id="grade"></strong> This method will take every value in the ArrayList and then create an array and return it to
        where the method was called.  Allowing you to take your ArrayList and turn it into an array.
