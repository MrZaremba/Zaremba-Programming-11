    <h1 class="text-lg-center">Classes</h1>
    <p>Classes in java are used to create complicated form of data abstraction.  Recall data abstraction is the process of
    giving meaning to our code.  The information we are coding into the computer represents something.  It can be a task,
    an object, or even an idea.  Classes are the crux of what we call Object Orientated Programming.  This idea of an object
    in programming is that we create a class that has an appropriate name for what data it is abstracting.  It contains
    <b>fields</b> and it contains <b>methods.</b>  These methods will not longer just be static methods that we can only call
    from our main class.  Here is the general formatting for a class:<br><code>
            public class <i>name</i>{<br>&emsp;fields<br>&emsp;methods<br>&emsp;}
        </code></p>

    <h2>Fields</h2>
    <p>Fields are properties that the class will have.  If we were making a class that was to represent a car we would
    need information such as: colour, maxSpeed, currentSpeed, make, model etc.  What ever we needed to run our
    program.  We create fields at the start of a class.  These fields will be created very similiar to how we create
    variables.  However, we need to add in some more information.  We use to initialize a variable with <code>
            int num;
        </code> Now we need more information.  We need to add on what we call <b>accessors</b>.  These are to determine
    what access are other classes allowed with this variable.  There are several but for now we will use two, <b>public</b>
      and <b>private</b>.  Public means that anywhere in our program from any class the variable can be accessed and changed.
    Private means that this variable can only be accessed from within the class itself.  Typically we are going to want to use
    private variables.  This is because we will want to make sure that the variables are not being misused.  A simple example would
     be if another class tried to change the speed of the car to a negative number.  However, our class does not allow for negative
     numbers and having this number negative may cause errors. By keeping variables private and restricting access we can make sure
     they stay are not manipulated in a way that causes errors.</p>
    <h2>Methods</h2>
    <p>If fields are the attributes of the car methods can be thought of as the behaviour of the car.  We can have methods such as
    speedUp, or slowDown.  The general formatting for a method is similar to a static method.  We also need to ensure in our signature
    that we have an accessor.  Just like fields we can have private or public methods.  Here is the general form:<br><code>
            <i>accessor return type name</i>(<i>parameters</i>){<br>&emsp;<i>body</i><br>&emsp;}<br>
        </code>Here is an example of a simple method for the car class.  <code><br>public void speedUp(){<br>&emsp;
            if(speed < maxSpeed) speed++;<br>&emsp;}
        <br></code>This would take the field speed and increment it by one as long as the condition of maxSpeed is passed.  Watch the
    following video to see this class created.</p>

    <h2>Check Your Understanding</h2>
    <p>Classes should only be used to describe a physical representation of something in reality.</p>

        <strong id="grade"></strong> False,  Classes can represnt more than just physical objects in reality.
        we use them to also represent ideas, or jobs.
