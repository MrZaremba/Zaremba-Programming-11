    <h1 class="text-lg-center">Using Classes</h1>
    <p>Last lesson we looked at how to do basic design of a class.  Now we will look at actually using a class in
    our program.  The first to use a class is to instantiate it.  This means we are going to make what we call an
    instance of the class.  Each instance of a class will contian all the same fields and methods as any other instance
    of that class.  However,  the value held in memory at the fields can be different.  For example with our car class
    all instances will have the variable called maxSpeed however the value held there can be different for each instance.
    To create an instance of a class we will use the <code>new</code> keyword.  This tells the compiiler to create a spot
    in memory that holds the new class and all of its information.  Example:<br><code>
            Car toyota = new Car();<br>
        </code> This code will create an instance of the car class and the variable toyota will point to its location
    in memory.  We can now access all the public fields and methods inside the class.  If we were to create another
    car instance we could set its fields to be different from the first.  This is the main idea of what we call
    <b>Object Orientated Programming.</b>  We create objects that represent any <b>Type</b> of data we want.
    This is also referred to as data abstraction</p>
    <h2>Constructors</h2>
    <p>Constructors are a special kind of method that runs when we instantiate an object.  This constructor can be used
    to "setup" our object with desired parameters.  Example of the <b>constructor</b> method inside our class:<br>
    <code>Car(int maxSpeed, String colour, String name){<br>&emsp;this.maxSpeed = maxSpeed;<br>&emsp;this.colour = colour;<br>
    &emsp;this.name = name;<br>&emsp;currentSpeed = 0;<br>&emsp;}</code><br>  This will run whenever we construct a car
    object.  It allows us to set values of the fields when it is created.  Notice the <b>this</b> keyword.  It is
    referring to the object itself and when we set it equal to a value without <b>this</b> we are setting it equal to
     what ever is being passed in as a parameter.</p>
    <h2>The Accessor</h2>
    <p>You have used accessors several times already.  They allow us to go into an object and access their public methods and
    fields.  We use "." to access the properties of an object.  Example:<br><code>toyota.speedUp();<br></code>This
    will go into the toyota instance of a class and run the method called speedUp.  Sometimes objects can hold other objects.
    In this case we can go into the first object and then use the reference name for the second object to access its fields or
    methods.  Example:<br><code>toyota.driver.getAge()<br></code>In this example the car class holds a reference to an
    object.  Perhaps a person object.  There reference is called driver.  When we access car class we can access Person class
    through the driver reference inside of the car class and then run its method of getAge().</p>
    <h2>Check Your Understanding</h2>

    <p>What would be the values of the fields if the class was created with the following line of code:<br><code>
        Person john = new Person(20, "Steve", "Programming");<br>
    </code></p>
    <div class="row">
        <div class="col-lg-4 answer" onclick="getAnswer(false)">Age:0<br>Name:john</div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 answer" onclick="getAnswer(false)">Age:20<br>Name:john<br>Interests:programming
        </div>
        <div class="col-lg-4 answer" onclick="getAnswer(true)">Age:20<br>Name:Steve<br>Interests;Programming
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="alert alert-success invisible" id="solution">
        <strong id="grade"></strong> Age = 20, Name = Steve, Interests = Programming.  <br>The name
        is not john because that is just the name of the variable that is holding the reference to the object.
        The object field called name is holding "Steve".
