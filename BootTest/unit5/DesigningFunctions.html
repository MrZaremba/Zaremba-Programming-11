    <h1 class="text-lg-center">Data Abstraction</h1>
    <p>We have mentioned the concept of data abstraction a few times in this course so far.  Now we are going to really get
    into the details on how exactly we can use this to write our programs.  The name comes from abstract art.  The meaning behind
    the art is hidden or blurred.  In programming we want to hide the details behind an interface (methods).  Outer classes use the
    interface and inside of the class you are creating does all the work below the surface.  An example from our lessons on classes
    would be the unique identifier in our Car class. We can get our car id num but how it was created happened below the surface. </p>
    <h2>How to Design Data Abstractions</h2>
    <p>We use classes to create our own data abstractions.  We learned they consist of fields and methods.  Some of these are
    private or happening below the surface while some are public which is creating the interface for the class.  Note: there
    is something in java called Interface, currently I am not referring to that nor will I for rest of course.  That is taught in
    programming 12.  The reason why we hide parts of our class is mainly so that we can keep our interface with the class constant.
    If we need to change the implementation of the code we can just change everything that is happening below the surface.  This
    method is preferred that way if you change a class you do not now have to go into all the classes that use it and change their
    interactions with it.  THe public interface has not changed.  We have 4 phases of designing our data Abstraction that will
    be covered in this unit they are <b>Specifications, Usage Scenarios, Test Specifications, and Implementation.</b></p>
    <p><b>Specification:</b> First thing we want to think about is what methods does this abstraction require?
        What is our public interface?</p>
    <p><b>Usage Scenarios:</b> Think about all the situations that our other classes are going to use the abstraction.</p>
    <p><b>Test Specifications:</b> Look at each method that we specified look at all the possible scenarios of usage
    and design tests to ensure it is working.</p>
    <p><b>Implement:</b> Involves deciding on an internal representation of the data in the abstraction, and then implementing the public
     and supporting private methods to make it work.</p>
